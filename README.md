# Cigarette-Smokers-Problem

#DESCRIPTION

The cigarette smokers problem problem was originally presented by Suhas Patil , who claimed that it cannot be solved with semaphores. That claim comes with some qualifications, but in any case the problem is interesting and chal- lenging. Four threads are involved: an agent and three smokers. The smokers loop forever, first waiting for ingredients, then making and smoking cigarettes. The ingredients are tobacco, paper, and matches. 
We assume that the agent has an infinite supply of all three ingredients, and each smoker has an infinite supply of one of the ingredients; that is, one smoker has matches, another has paper, and the third has tobacco.
The agent repeatedly chooses two different ingredients at random and makes them available to the smokers. 
Depending on which ingredients are chosen, the smoker with the complementary ingredient should pick up both resources and proceed.
For example, if the agent puts out tobacco and paper, the smoker with the matches should pick up both ingredients, make a cigarette, and then signal the agent.
To explain the premise, the agent represents an operating system that al- locates resources, and the smokers represent applications that need resources. 
The problem is to make sure that if resources are available that would allow one more more applications to proceed, those applications should be woken up. Conversely, we want to avoid waking an application if it cannot proceed.
